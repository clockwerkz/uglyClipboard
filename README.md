A timer designed for custom workouts

My wife and I love using a 7 minute workout app. It has a series of pre determined workouts you can select from, or create a custom workout.
The app then runs through the workouts, giving you 45 seconds to do the exercise with a 10 second break period. Unfortunately, we are limited
to the workouts on the app. So what I'm making is a basic timer. It'll allow one to select from 30 sec, 45 sec, or 1 min intervals, and then 
set the rest time in between exercies. I also would like to add the option to enter in the workouts so while the exercise timer is active,
it displays what the current exercise is. Another feature I'd like to add is sound cues, as well as a timer cue.
